The Author had released this program as Public Domain and Open Source.
"You can do with this software whatever you want"


Thanks to the Author, Jeroen Hoppenbrouwers (hoppie@home.nl), for making it open source.

CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE
-----------------------------
The use of an .INI file to retain all mixer settings between sessions has
been extended and the mixer now correctly picks up current SoundBlaster
settings when re-activated during a session. The "-" command line parameter
to force PMMIXER to start minimized has been removed in anticipation to the
next revision. No other externally visible modifications have taken place.


SHORT FUTURE
------------
Next phase will be addition of command line parameters to set up the
mixer by hand. Handy for "standard" settings. As soon as somebody provides
me with a SoundBlaster 16ASP, I will gladly rewrite this program to control
the 16ASP (hint hint). A bit further away, I might try to use as much of
MMPM/2 as practical and do the rest in hardware. If only I could get API
support...


What is PMMIXER?
----------------
PMMIXER is a PM program to access the internal mixer on the SoundBlaster Pro.
It displays the look-alike of a normal mixing console, with sliders and
pushbuttons to control the SoundBlaster Pro's mixer manually.


Why do I need PMMIXER?
----------------------
Because your precious SoundBlaster Pro has many controls that you cannot
possibly use with the sparse OS/2 MMPM/2 drivers. Especially people
who have attached a CD-ROM player to the CD-Input connector of the
SoundBlaster *need* this mixer program to be able to hear anything.


What do I need to run PMMIXER?
------------------------------
Naturally, you need a SoundBlaster Pro sound card. Again, be warned
that OS/2 does not like this card to work on IRQ channel 7, because this IRQ
is reserved for the LPT1 device. Put the SoundBlaster Pro on IRQ 5 or so.
Since this is a beta version, there's no provision for SoundBlasters on
other addresses than 0x220. Normally, there's no reason to set the card
to another address, so it will probably work right away. If someone needs
other IO adresses, please ask me for it. IRQ and DMA is not used at all.


How do I run PMMIXER?
---------------------
To run PMMIXER just type 'START PMMIXER' at an OS/2 prompt, or double click
on the file object for PMMIXER.EXE. You can also shadow the PMMIXER file
object into a folder of your choice, to easily get to it, or create a real
Program Object.

Be careful to start PMMIXER in the directory where you want the PMMIXER.INI
file to be created (or to be found). You can include the default directory
in the appropriate field of the Program Object.


How do I work with PMMIXER?
---------------------------
The program is pretty much self explanatory. The sliders control the volume
levels for the various inputs and outputs of the SB Pro. The push buttons
control the recording source and whether or not certain filters are
enabled. Play around while producing some music (e.g. by running TRACKER)
and you'll figure out how it all works.

In the System Menu of the mixer (the little black-and-white mixer icon in the
top-left corner of the window) I've added an About box choice that displays
some information about version number and such (and wastes a few CPU cycles
on you) plus a small Help choice that currently gives some beta information.

PMMIXER should not interfere with other programs that use the AMPMIX device or
access the SoundBlaster directly. It will not, however, update itself as soon
as the SoundBlaster settings are changed. The update will come as soon as you
re-activate the mixer, e.g. by clicking on it.

On the other hand, if you switch to Agressive mode, PMMIXER *will*
bluntly reset SB levels to what you told them to be every 1/10th of a
second. This is to overrule %$#@@%$ MMPM/2 that thinks it knows better
what you want than you do yourself (hey, it still is IBM, isn't it?).


What are the known bugs?
------------------------
The only "bug" that remains (or so I think) is not something I can do much
about. The program works by putting bytes directly into the Sound Blaster
hardware. The design of this card causes such input to interfere with
a simultaneous stereo sample playback: you have a 50% chance that the
left and right channels suddenly swap place! This will not happen while
manipulating slider controls, only with push buttons.
In Agressive mode, the program inputs hardware mixer control bytes into
the Sound Blaster every 1/10th of a second. This leads to random panning of
any stereo sound that gets played.

I could do two things about this:

A) Replace Agressive mode by a less agressive one that only re-sets sliders,
B) Use an API instead of hardware access. Creative Labs, pleaaase?!

If people would be happy with the less agressive slider-only mode, please
tell me. I suspect many people to do little or nothing with the push buttons
and therefore it won't matter much to keep them out of Agressive mode.

I did my best to code the PMMIXER display-independently. On my 1024*768*256
screen it looks pretty neat. It might be that on other lower or higher 
resolution screens some graphics are screwed up. If so, please notify me,
so that I can change the program appropriately.

Some folks complained about the lousy look of the small mixer icon. In
my opinion I lack space to create something like the big mixer in the
About box. But if someone really cares, just mail me your new icon.


Who else gets credit?
---------------------
First, David Nichols (davidn@cs.tamu.edu) who wrote what is now version 1.0
of PMMIXER. Since this was my first encounter with OS/2 PM programming,
many thanks to David for implicitly teaching me how to do things.

Second, Michael Fulbright (msf@as.arizona.edu) for providing us OS/2 fanatics
with a good SoundBlaster driver and some useful documentation on it. 
Unfortunately for his ego, IBM decided not to buy his drivers.

Third, some people at IBM for giving birth to OS/2 2.x which is by far the
nicest operating system for Intel-based computers that I've encountered
so far.


Are the sources available?
--------------------------
Of course they are. Just mail me (hoppie@kub.nl) and you'll get them.
Since this is a beta release, code still is under development.


What about MMPM/2?
------------------
I would *love* to re-write this program to correctly control the Sound
Blaster Pro through MMPM/2. However, Creative Labs decided to screw us
and did a bad job on writing drivers. No mixer support at all.
Hopefully they will learn quickly after having a good look at the
Pro Audio Spectrum (PAS-16) drivers.


What about other sound cards?
-----------------------------
For this one, I would prefer a *generic* API to program to, but this
will probably not be for the forseeable future. As a temporary solution,
send me your favorite sound card and I'll see what I can do  :-)


DISCLAIMER
----------
I (and probably David and Michael as well) take no responsibility whatsoever
about the correct functioning of this program. It is provided for free
to everyone who happens to like it and will cost $100 for others.

Having said this, I might try to adjust the program if someone kindly points
me to a flaw or an improvement.
